# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacques Nunes and I'm a Tech Lead and Develop. I've been working with (Senior 30+ | Tech Lead | Software Engineer | Full Stack | PHP | Laravel | CodeIgniter | API | JavaScript | Typescript | React | Next | CSS | MySQL | GitFlow | Docker Compose | Linux | Azure | AWS | Terraform | DevSecOps) and I'm currently Tech Lead at Lessclick.

I am passionate about Technology. I work with technology and in my free time, I study more about technology.

Virtually all the projects I have worked on are in private repositories, but I have a technical test project that I did for the TJ, which is in a public repository right here: https://bitbucket.org/jacquesxnunes/spassu-tj/src/develop/README.md
